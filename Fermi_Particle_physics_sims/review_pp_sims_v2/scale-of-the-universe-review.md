# Review — scale-of-the-universe.html ("Smaller Things Need Higher-Energy Probes", curriculum: Simulation Descriptions row "Scale of the Universe" · Syllabus V2 Lecture 2 "Scales")
**Verdict:** Core physics is exact — d × E_min = ħc holds at every sampled position of both sliders (31 log-spaced points, both drive directions) and both animated reveals land on the stated values (1.70 mm/116 µeV; 1.70 fm/116 MeV) — but three P1 non-physics bugs need fixing: the paused-state transport is dead (`window.Shell` is undefined so `play()` is a no-op — buttons and card reveals silently do nothing while paused), Reset desyncs the scene from the active inquiry card, and the Formal layer renders a red literal `\cdotp` inside ħc ≈ 0.1973 GeV·fm; plus the curriculum's fundamental-forces panel is absent (deliberate, per in-file POLISH note).
**Console:** clean (only `GET /favicon.ico` 404 from the python dev server — not a sim asset; zero pageerrors, zero sim console errors across all five sessions).  **Combos tested:** 58 exhaustive (pin-step cycles both directions incl. 4 extreme no-ops, 5-card walk correct+wrong paths, all header toggles both states) + ~150 sampled (31 slider points, 8 band boundaries, flow-mutation grid, 80-event scrub stress).
**Method note:** headless Chrome (puppeteer, 1440×900, `document.hidden = false` — rAF live, animations real); driven via DOM events + `window.__audit`; screenshots in scratchpad (`sotu-*.png`).

- **[PHY-P2-1] [high]** Card 4 states "The proton is 100,000× smaller still (1.7 fm)" — actual 10⁻¹⁰ m / 1.7 fm = 58,824× (4.77 decades). The correct-choice label "About 100,000× more" and fb "five decades" carry the same rounding; stated as plain fact in the card prose. Repro: open card 4. Evidence: explicit calc in transcript. Anchor: card 4 `<p>`, L460. → **Fix:** "~60,000× (nearly five decades) smaller still" or "about 10⁵× smaller"; keep the choice labels' "About".

## NON-PHYSICS
### P0
none
### P1
- **[NP-P1-1] [flow] [high]** Paused-state transport is dead: `play()` guards on `window.Shell`, but `const Shell` is a top-level lexical binding, so `typeof window.Shell === 'undefined'` (verified) and `play()` never resumes. While paused: ◀ bigger/smaller ▶ clicks show nothing (d frozen at "1.70 m" for 3 s; state DID move — resuming manually then eased to 80.8 µm), and answering card 2 leaves the promised zoom frozen ("the zoom runs and tests it" / "watch E_min climb" — nothing moves, still "▶ Play"; card 4's proton reveal same path). Evidence: sotu-E run + sotu-paused-reveal.png. Anchor: `function play(){ ... if (window.Shell && Shell.setPlaying) ... }` L1555. → **Fix:** drop the `window.` qualifier — `if (typeof Shell!=='undefined' && Shell.setPlaying) Shell.setPlaying(true);` (Shell is defined before the sim IIFE runs).
- **[NP-P1-2] [flow] [high]** Reset desyncs the scene from the active inquiry card: `onReset` always returns to HOME. Repro: pager to card 3 ("d = 100 nm — a virus, E_min reads 1.97 eV") → ↻ Reset → readouts 1.70 m / 116 neV, card 3 still active and now contradicted. Evidence: sotu-reset-desync.png; card3before/afterReset in transcript. Anchor: `onReset()` L1654. → **Fix:** after zeroing, re-apply the active card's spec — `onStep(Shell.step)` — the pattern used in build-a-baryon's fix (guard for the collapsed/completed state, where HOME is correct).
- **[NP-P1-3] [functional] [high]** ∑ Formal eq2 renders "ℏc ≈ 0.1973 GeV**\cdotp**fm" with the literal macro name in red — KaTeX cannot take "·" inside `\text{}`. The sim's headline constant is the one garbled. Repro: toggle ∑ Formal. Evidence: sotu-formal.png. Anchor: `katex.render('E_{\\min}=pc=...\\text{GeV·fm}', b, ...)` L1626. → **Fix:** `\\text{GeV}\\cdot\\text{fm}` (also keeps the plain-text fallback unchanged).
- **[NP-P1-4] [pedagogy] [high]** Curriculum affordance absent: Simulation Descriptions requires "Info panel also notes the strength of fundamental forces at this scale", and the Lecture-2 inquiry "What scales do each of the forces matter at?" is not answerable from the screen. The in-file POLISH note documents this as a deliberate cut ("one concept only — force bars … are gone"). Anchor: POLISH comment L338; no force UI anywhere. → **Fix:** product decision — either restore a minimal per-scale force note in the "At this scale" panel, or amend the curriculum row; report both sources per skill conflict rule.
### P2
- **[NP-P2-1] [flow] [high]** The first slider input after load is swallowed once per session: the input handler calls `userMove()` → `revealScale()` → `Shell.refit()` → `onResize` → `updateUI`, which rewrites the slider from `S.view` *before* the handler reads its value. Repro: fresh load → set size slider to −8 → value snaps back to −0.22, d stays ~1.7 m; second identical input works. A single click-on-track or first keyboard arrow is visibly ignored; drags lose only the first event. Anchor: `eScale`/`eEnergy` input handlers L1562–1571 (`userMove()` before the read). → **Fix:** read `parseFloat(e.target.value)` into a local *before* calling `userMove()`, or set `S.logd/S.view` first and call `userMove()` after.
- **[NP-P2-2] [cosmetic] [med]** Endpoint precision: energy-slider min corner displays d = "99,997 km" (not 100,000 km) because the hard-coded slider bounds use LOGC to 4 decimals (−23.7048) vs log10(ħc) = −15.704806…; boot slider position also snaps −0.23 → −0.22 (step 0.02 grid from min −8), so the first touch lands at 1.66 m rather than 1.70 m. Anchor: `#sim-energy` min/max L494, `HOME=0.23` vs step grid L489. → **Fix:** derive slider bounds from LOGC at full precision in JS (or accept; display-only).

## Curriculum checklist
- Zoom Earth → quark scale with pinned landmarks (Earth, human, hair, cell, virus, molecule, atom, nucleus, proton, quark) → **met** (all 10 pins at canonical sizes: 1.27×10⁷ m, 1.7 m, 80 µm, 12 µm, 100 nm, 1 nm, 10⁻¹⁰ m, 10 fm, 1.7 fm, <10⁻¹⁸ m — checked vs canon/PDG-scale values)
- Scale OR energy of probe as control, emphasizing the inverse relationship → **met** (two locked log sliders; link exact both directions — the sim's headline invariant)
- Log ruler at bottom with slider/cursor + log energy bar → **met** (drag-scrubbing cursor, dual axes, decade ticks)
- Info panel: length scale, energy to probe it, imaging tech (visible light / x-ray / electron microscope / collider) → **met** ("At this scale" panel + min-probe chip: radio/IR/visible/UV/X-ray/γ/collider + 4-band tech strip)
- Info panel notes strength of fundamental forces at this scale → **NOT met → NP-P1-4** (deliberately removed per POLISH note)
- LO "Explain how higher momenta can probe shorter distances" → **met** (answerable: E = ħc/d on every readout, card spine is exactly this claim)
- Inquiry "order-of-magnitude comparison quark vs molecule" → **answerable** (ruler: 1 nm vs 10⁻¹⁸ m = 9 decades; card 5 after-text says it explicitly)
- Inquiry "Why have we still not been able to get a clear look at quarks?" → **answerable** (card 5 + "collision debris only — never a photograph" band note)
- "Lecture Display" learning mode → **met** (🎓 Lecture verified)
- Optional "extension could go big to galaxy clusters" → not implemented (ruler tops at 10⁸ m); optional wording, no finding

## To verify (human)
- The "beyond any machine" cutoff at d < 2×10⁻¹⁹ m (≈ 1 TeV momentum transfer) is a defensible round number for the LHC's direct spatial resolution, but contact-interaction limits are often quoted as probing ~10⁻¹⁹–10⁻²⁰ m; confirm the course wants the conservative teaching value.
- Whether Hide-Text booting CHECKED (hiding the E_min massless-probe caveat by default) is still the curriculum team's intent — the registry note says so, and behaviour matches, but it hides the sim's one model-honesty caveat from first-time viewers.
- NP-P1-2's fix should keep HOME on Reset when the inquiry is collapsed/completed (free-exploration mode) and only re-apply the card spec while a card is open.

## FIXES APPLIED (2026-08-26)
| ID | Verdict | Evidence / change |
|---|---|---|
| PHY-P2-1 | CONFIRMED + FIXED | Recomputed with the sim's own values: 10⁻¹⁰ m / 1.7×10⁻¹⁵ m = 58,824× (4.77 decades) — "100,000×" overstated 1.7×. Card-4 prose reworded to "The proton is almost five orders of magnitude smaller still (1.7 fm)."; choice labels ("About 100,000×") left untouched per the review's fix note. Verified live post-fix. |
| NP-P1-1 | ALREADY-RESOLVED | SYS-1 sweep added `window.Shell = Shell` (L772); `typeof window.Shell === "object"` verified live at boot. `play()` guard untouched. |
| NP-P1-2 | ALREADY-RESOLVED | SYS-2 sweep added `onStep(Shell.step)` inside `onReset()` ("re-sync the scene to the ACTIVE card (SYS-2)"). Untouched. |
| NP-P1-3 | CONFIRMED + FIXED | ∑ Formal eq2 rendered a red literal `\cdotp` between GeV and fm (screenshot sotu-scale-confirm-formal-eq2.png). KaTeX string changed to `\text{GeV}\cdot\text{fm}`; renders "GeV · fm" (sotu-scale-verify-eq2.png); plain-text fallback unchanged. |
| NP-P2-1 | REFUTED | Does not reproduce: 3 independent fresh loads, single synthetic input on `#sim-scale` (value −8) → readout updated to "100,000 km" immediately, slider value retained, second input identical — no swallow. Mechanism check: the described overwrite path (`userMove → revealScale → Shell.refit → onResize → updateUI` rewriting the slider before the handler reads it) exists in code but is unreachable — the sim now boots via `setLectureMode(true)` (L751, "curriculum request"), whose `finishInquiry → onComplete → revealScale()` sets `scaleShown = true` before any user input, and `scaleShown` never resets. No code change. |
| NP-P2-2 | CONFIRMED + FIXED | Live at the exact min corner (energy slider = −23.7048): d read "99,997 km" (computed logd = LOGC + 23.7048 = 7.99999). Fix: `eEnergy` input handler snaps the computed logd to the slider's own 2-dp resolution (`Math.round(x*100)/100`) before clamping — min corner now reads "100,000 km / 1.97 feV", max corner "0.10 am / 1.97 TeV". Note: the review's suggested fix (full-precision JS bounds) was tried first and rejected — it breaks the 0.02 step grid's divisibility so the top drag stop lands at max−0.02 (E capped at 1.88 TeV); the handler-side snap keeps both endpoints reachable. HTML bounds and boot value untouched. |
| NP-P1-4 | ASSESSED-ONLY | Verified: POLISH change-log (L338) documents the deliberate cut — "[pedagogy] one concept only — force bars, 'force relevance' copy and force-based inquiry cards are gone" and "forceRel() and its four undefined 0–100% bars deleted". No force UI exists. Recommendation: keep the cut (the sim's single-concept focus d·E = ħc is its strength, and force strengths vs scale is a different lesson); instead amend the curriculum row, or if the curriculum team insists, add one static line to the "At this scale" panel naming the dominant force at the current band — needs the user's call. |

Post-fix regression run (headless 1440×900, fresh load): zero pageerrors; Hide-Text boots CHECKED with the one registered note hidden; d×E = ħc held at 9 slider points across the full range (readouts 1.97/197 pairs at every decade); both energy-slider corners clean; formal panel renders all three equations.

## Second review scan (2026-08-26)
**Scope:** Re-audit after commit `0dab193` (PHY-P2-1, NP-P1-3, NP-P2-2 fixes; SYS-1/SYS-2 sweep). Read-only; new findings only. Method: Chrome MCP + puppeteer-style deterministic slider drive; core invariant `d·E = ħc = 0.19732697 GeV·fm` spot-checked at 16 slider positions across the full 27-decade range plus both endpoint corners — every displayed pair rounds to 0.197 GeV·fm within 3-sig-fig display precision (max err 0.166 %, which is the 0.1973 → 0.197 rounding). Physics core unchanged and correct: card-1/3/4/5 canonical readouts recomputed via `node -e` (116 neV / 1.97 eV / 116 MeV / 197 GeV) match on screen; atom-to-proton ratio 10⁻¹⁰ / 1.7 fm = 58,824× = 4.77 decades matches the "almost five orders of magnitude" card-4 rewording.

**Fix regressions verified (all clean):** `window.Shell === "object"` at boot (NP-P1-1 stays fixed); pausing then clicking a pin flips `Shell.playing → true` (paused-transport wake-through live); ∑ Formal eq2 renders "ℏc ≈ 0.1973 GeV · fm" with proper `\cdot` in the KaTeX tree and 0 `.katex-error` nodes (NP-P1-3 fixed); energy-slider min corner reads exactly "100,000 km / 1.97 feV" and max corner "0.10 am / 1.97 TeV" (NP-P2-2 fixed); Reset while an inquiry CARD is active syncs the scene to that card (card-3 → 100 nm / 1.97 eV — SYS-2 fixed for the card-active case). Card-4 prose reads "The proton is almost five orders of magnitude smaller still (1.7 fm)" (PHY-P2-1 fixed).

### P1
- **[NP-P1-5] [flow] [high]** SYS-2 fix over-reaches into the lecture / completed / inquiry-collapsed state: `onReset()` unconditionally calls `onStep(Shell.step)` after zeroing to HOME, and `Shell.step` (getter for `inqStep`) is left at 4 after `finishInquiry()` — so Reset in Lecture-mode or after Finish → jumps the scene to `STEPS[4] = -18` (readouts snap to **1.00 am / 197 GeV**, the quark scale) instead of returning to human scale. This is the very corner the prior review's "To verify" note flagged. Repro (deterministic, 3× fresh loads): Lecture ON (or click Finish → through the inquiry) so `#shell` gains `.lecture-mode .inquiry-collapsed` and `Shell.step === 4` — move the size slider to any value (e.g. sv = 0 → d = 1.00 m) — click ↻ Reset. Observed: d = **1.00 am**, E = **197 GeV**, scale slider snaps to 18. Expected in this mode: d = 1.70 m, E = 116 neV, scale slider = −0.22 (HOME, per the prior review's stated intent for free-exploration Reset). Because the sim boots via `setLectureMode(true)` (L751, curriculum request), the first Reset a student ever clicks lands in this bug path. Evidence: `sotu-rev2-reset-in-lecture-mode.jpg` (post-Reset scene: quark ruler pin lit, "quark · < 10⁻¹⁸ m" caption, min-probe chip "collider beam"); deterministic snapshot log in transcript. Anchor: `onReset()` L1658–L1663 in scale-of-the-universe.html. → **Fix:** guard the re-sync — `if (!shellRoot.classList.contains('inquiry-collapsed')) onStep(Shell.step);` (or equivalent, e.g. gate on `Shell.step < STEPS.length && document.querySelector('#inq-cards .inq-step.active')`) so Reset re-applies the card spec only while a card is open, and returns to HOME in the free-exploration / lecture / completed states.

### P2
- **[NP-P2-3] [ux] [med]** Hide-Text button tooltip is stale: `title="Hide Text — hides registered labels/readouts; registry is empty until items are added"` (L375), but this sim's registry has **one** DOM item (the E_min explainer `p.sim-note.ht-hide`) and the checkbox is deliberately `checked` at boot — so the tooltip contradicts the visible boot state (the "hide-text" class is on `#shell` from load 1 and the note is already hidden). Repro: hover the Hide Text pill on any fresh load. Anchor: header markup L375. → **Fix:** align the tooltip with the registry ("Hide Text — hides the E_min massless-probe caveat by default; uncheck to show" or simply "Hide the registered E_min caveat"), or drop the misleading "registry is empty" phrase.

## Assessment of the "PHYSICS" bucket
All spot-checked numbers agree with canon to display precision. The sim's core `E·d = ħc` invariant is exact within the two-decimal slider grid and 3-sig-fig readout rounding across the full 27-decade range; pin values match canon (Earth diameter 1.274×10⁷ m; human 1.7 m; hair 80 µm; virus 100 nm; atom 10⁻¹⁰ m = 1 Å; proton 1.7 fm = diameter; quark point-like < 10⁻¹⁸ m). ħc numeric constant matches `LOGC = log₁₀(0.19732697×10⁻¹⁵) = −15.7048` in code (L787). No new physics finding.

## To verify (human, second pass)
- NP-P1-5 fix scope: confirm the intended behaviour for ↻ Reset when the inquiry is (a) collapsed via Lecture ON, (b) collapsed via Finish →, and (c) reopened at card 1 via the restore chip. Prior review's own "To verify" comment already said Reset should HOME in the collapsed/completed state — this second scan promotes that concern from advisory to a live P1 bug.
- NP-P1-4 (fundamental-forces panel absent) status unchanged: still ASSESSED-ONLY, awaiting product decision on curriculum vs POLISH note.
