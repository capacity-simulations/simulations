# Review — feynman-diagram-sandbox.html ("Feynman Diagram Sandbox", curriculum: Simulation Descriptions row "Feynman Diagram Sandbox" · Lecture 12 Scattering and Feynman Diagrams)
**Verdict:** Physics core fully clean — all 1296 in/out lepton-pair combinations produce exactly the independently-derived vertex verdict (charge vs per-flavour lepton number vs threshold), every σ number on screen matches LO QED to display precision, and the τ threshold, γ* q² = s label, sweep, gates and one-shot σ commit all behave as designed. One physics-presentation P1 (band curve stays the massless 1/s reference while titled as the built process) and one flow P1 (Reset desyncs the scene from the active inquiry card), plus polish.
**Console:** clean across 4 sessions (no pageerror; one 404 = `/favicon.ico` — the page ships no favicon link; server artifact, not a sim asset).  **Combos tested:** 1296 exhaustive (all in-pair × out-pair at √s = 3) + 42 threshold-grid (6 key combos × 7 √s incl. 3.54/3.55 straddle) + ~60 sampled (census walks, flow mutations, stress, corners).
**Method note:** headless Chrome (puppeteer) at 1440×900 + 1100×760; verdict chip lives on canvas, so it was read via a `fillText` interceptor; all synthetic pointer events (real-device drag → To verify).

## PHYSICS
### P0
none
### P1
- **[PHY-P1-1] [high]** The σ(√s) band always plots the massless reference σ₀ = 4πα²/3s but titles it with the built process: with e⁻e⁺ → τ⁻τ⁺ at √s = 4.00, header reads "σ(e⁻ e⁺ → τ⁻ τ⁺), log–log", yet the curve shows no τ threshold (curve ≈ 5.4 nb at 4 GeV; the measured point σ = 3.477 nb sits visibly below it), and the s·σ ring rides the 86.85 line while the Result panel reads s·σ = 55.69 nb·GeV². Card 5 sends students to "hunt the τ threshold" on this plot — the point dives, the curve doesn't. Repro: commit σ prediction → build e⁻e⁺→τ⁻τ⁺ → √s 4 GeV. Evidence: fds-08-band-tau4.png + roInv readout. Anchor: `drawBand` — 1/s curve loop uses `sigma0(v)`, title uses `r.proc` (~L1191–1205). → **Fix:** when a valid massive process is built, plot `sigmaOf(v, r.mf)` (threshold-cut curve, e.g. as a second line) or retitle the drawn curve "massless 1/s reference" and keep the process name only on the measured point.
### P2
- **[PHY-P2-1] [high]** "s·σ = 86.85 nb·GeV² (constant in √s)" line/label vs readout: at √s = 1.00 GeV (μ⁻μ⁺) roInv shows 86.79 nb·GeV² — the μ-mass β(3−β²)/2 factor (0.99927). Physically correct readout; the "constant" claim holds only in the massless limit. Evidence: numerics table, √s = 1 row. Anchor: `drawBand` invLong string. → **Fix:** append "(massless limit)" to the constant-line label.
- **[PHY-P2-2] [med]** Threshold message "✗ needs √s ≥ 3.55 GeV" rounds 2m_τ = 3.5537 down, so the literal claim is false for √s ∈ [3.550, 3.5537); unreachable via the log slider (adjacent ticks land at 3.5394 → 3.5539, so displayed "3.55 GeV" is always already allowed) — code-path only. Anchor: `analyze()` `thr.toFixed(2)` (~L860). → **Fix:** display `Math.ceil(thr*100)/100` ("3.56") or "3.554".

## NON-PHYSICS
### P0
none
### P1
- **[NP-P1-1] [flow] [high]** Reset desyncs the scene from the active inquiry card: `onReset` empties all four legs and resumes play, so with card 2/3/4/5 active the card asserts an on-screen state ("μ⁻μ⁺ passes both counts: ✓ QED allowed") while the canvas shows "empty diagram · legs 0/4". Repro: pager to card 3 → ↻ Reset. Observed live: before {proc e⁻e⁺→μ⁻μ⁺, ✓ QED allowed} → after {proc —, legs 0/4, card index unchanged}. Anchor: `onReset` (~L1443). → **Fix:** when the inquiry is open, re-apply the active card's spec after the field reset — `onStep(Shell.step)` — the same pattern applied to build-a-baryon's NP-P1-1.
### P2
- **[NP-P2-1] [overlap] [high]** Band x-axis title "√s (GeV)" (right-aligned at px1) overlaps the "30" tick label (centred at lx(30) = px1): renders as "√s (GeV)0" at every viewport tested (1440 dark, 1100 light). Evidence: fds-06/08/13 screenshots, bottom-right of band. Anchor: `drawBand` axis-title fillText at (px1, py1+4) vs tick loop. → **Fix:** right-align the 30 tick label or draw the axis title above the tick row / at px1 − 24.
- **[NP-P2-2] [ux] [med]** In the short band strip (118–190 px) the measured-point label "σ = 9.650 nb" can collide with the s·σ ring marker + label when √s sits near an anchor (seen at 1100×760, light, √s = 3). Legibility only. Evidence: fds-13-light-1100.png. Anchor: `drawBand` point-label offset logic (only avoids px1/py0 edges). → **Fix:** include the s·σ marker y in the label-offset test.

## Curriculum checklist
- Lecture 12 "Cross sections, exchange particles, interaction vertices, virtual particles" → **met** (σ readout + band; γ* exchange; V₁/V₂ enforce rules; "virtual — no trajectory" labelling)
- The lesson: invalid vertices rejected with the right conservation law (charge vs per-flavour lepton number) → **met** — 1296/1296 exhaustive verdict match; charge flagged before lepton number, each family counted separately
- "Feynman diagram builder / cross section calculator (simple interactions only, one-loop)" → **met as tree-level LO** (single s-channel γ*; no loop diagrams — see To verify on the "one-loop" phrase)
- Adjustable param "Scrub through time" → **met** (sweep slider + canvas scrub + Play sweep with replay flash)
- "Drag interactions or particles into the diagram builder" → **met** (drag and click-assign chips onto legs)
- "Compute amplitude off to the side" → **met** (Result panel σ / s·σ; full amplitude chain behind ∑ Formal)
- LO "Interpret a Feynman diagram qualitatively, then construct one" → **answerable from the screen** (card 1/4 interpret; cards 2/3 + sandbox construct)
- "Fermi's golden rule and cross section computation" → **partially**: no golden-rule statement by name; the flux × phase-space 1/(64π²s) narrative carries the equivalent point (reasonable for the sim's scope; the lecture column assigns golden rule to tutorial, not this sim)
- Learning mode Guided Inquiry → **met** (5 cards, gates on 2/3/5, predict-before-reveal σ)
- Title/Info modal vs curriculum entry → **met** (Info physics all verified: 86.85 nb·GeV², anchors, Bhabha t-channel caveat, √s ≪ M_Z validity)

## To verify (human)
- Curriculum phrase "one-loop": the sim is tree-level (one photon exchange, zero loops). If "one-loop" was meant literally (radiative corrections / running α), that is absent — the sim even pins α = 1/137.036 "no running" explicitly. Most likely the planning doc meant "single diagram"; confirm with curriculum owner.
- Chip drag-and-drop was exercised with synthetic PointerEvents (assign on drop verified); a quick manual drag on a real pointer/touch device would close the loop.
- PHY-P1-1 fix choice (threshold-cut curve vs relabel) is a design call — the current caption "◆ reference anchors · … massless beams" does partially disclose the massless curve.
- Exact threshold √s = 2m_τ uses strict `<` (allowed with β = 0, σ = 0) — only reachable programmatically; behaviour is physically sensible either way.

## FIXES APPLIED (2026-08-26)
Each finding was independently reproduced (headless Chrome 1440×900 + 1100×760, canvas `fillText` interceptor, `node -e` LO-QED recomputation) before any edit. Zero pageerrors before and after; post-fix σ readouts re-verified against σ = (4πα²/3s)·β(3−β²)/2 (86.79 nb at √s = 1 μμ, 9.650 nb at 3, 2.047 nb at 6.51, ττ 3.477 nb / s·σ 55.69 at 4.002 — all match node to display precision, slider snap/quantisation accounted for).

| ID | verdict | evidence / change |
|---|---|---|
| PHY-P1-1 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | Repro: ττ at √s = 4.00 → title "σ(e⁻ e⁺ → τ⁻ τ⁺)" over the smooth σ₀ curve (5.43 nb at 4 GeV), point σ = 3.477 nb visibly off it, no threshold (fds-pre-band-tau4-1440.png). Fix (threshold-curve option, keeps card 5's "hunt the τ threshold" truthful): `analyze()` now sets `r.mf`/`r.outOK` whenever the final-state pair is well-formed (even below threshold); `drawBand` draws the accent curve as `sigmaOf(v, r.mf)` cut exactly at √s = 2m_f, with the massless 1/s curve kept as a dashed muted "massless 1/s reference" (drawn only when the threshold is inside the plotted range, so μμ/ee stay a single curve). Point now sits on the labelled curve; threshold dive visible at 3.554 (fds-post-band-tau4-1440.png). |
| PHY-P2-1 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | Repro: chip "s·σ = 86.85 nb·GeV² (constant in √s)" vs roInv 86.79 nb·GeV² at √s = 1.00 (μ-mass factor; node: σ₀(1) = 86.8545, s·σ(μμ,1) = 86.79). Fix per review: chip now reads "(constant in √s, massless limit)" (short form "(massless limit)"). |
| PHY-P2-2 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | Repro: chip "✗ needs √s ≥ 3.55 GeV" at √s = 3.54 while 2m_τ = 3.55372; literal claim false on [3.550, 3.5537) (unreachable — adjacent log-slider ticks 3.5394/3.5539 — code-path only, as reviewed). Fix: `thr.toFixed(3)` → "✗ needs √s ≥ 3.554 GeV" (exact-value option); card 3's choice text, feedback (2m_τ = 3.554 GeV) and inq-after updated to keep the card's verbatim quote of the chip true. Live: card-3 build shows "✗ needs √s ≥ 3.554 GeV", drag past → "✓ QED allowed · near threshold (β = 0.01)". |
| NP-P1-1 | **ALREADY-RESOLVED** | Fixed by the systemic sweep (SYS-2) per task instruction — not touched. |
| NP-P2-1 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | Repro: axis title right edge at px1 = 1074 vs "30" tick spanning [1066.8, 1081.2] at the same y → 7.2 px overlap ("√s (GeV)0") at both 1440 and 1100. Fix: title drawn at px1 − 24 (review's option); post-fix bboxes disjoint at both viewports. |
| NP-P2-2 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | Repro at 1100×760, μμ, √s = 3: "σ = 9.650 nb" bbox [362.7–463.5]×[43.6–60.6] overlaps the "s·σ" label bbox [360.7–377.2]×[45.7–57.7]. Fix: point-label offset test now also dodges the s·σ ring + label zone (pushes the label to mY + 34, clamped above py1, which also clears the ◆ "9.65 nb" anchor caption); post-fix bboxes disjoint (fds-post2-band-mumu3-1100.png). |

Post-fix regression pass: full inquiry walk (cards 1→5, gates, card-3 data-build, card-5 one-shot commit) — σ locked "—" pre-commit, reveal + "your ÷4" ghost + "actual at 2√s" drawn, s·σ stays 86.85 as √s doubles; lecture-mode boot unchanged. Screenshots in the session scratchpad (fds-pre-*/fds-post-*/fds-post2-*).

## Second review scan (2026-08-26)

**Scope:** re-verify prior fixes and hunt for anything new. All prior fixes (PHY-P1-1 curve, PHY-P2-1 chip label, PHY-P2-2 threshold text, NP-P2-1 axis-title overlap, NP-P2-2 point-label collision, NP-P1-1 reset desync) confirmed still applied at 1440×900: σ(ee→ττ) accent curve rises from the labelled dashed massless-reference at √s = 3.554 (screenshot fds-rev2-card5-inqdone-reveal-1440.jpg shows 3.554 GeV chip live; reset from card 3 keeps card 3 active with μμ baseline re-applied). Physics numerics (σ_QED = 4πα²/3s · β(3−β²)/2 with (ħc)² = 389379.37 nb·GeV²) re-verified against `node -e` across μμ {1,3,10} and ττ {3.554, 3.56, 4, 5, 30} — all match on-screen readouts to display precision. Info-modal opens and its 4 KaTeX equations render correctly through ∑ Formal.

Two NEW findings (both scoped to boot-in-Lecture behavior added since the first review):

### PHYSICS
#### P0   none
#### P1   none
#### P2
- **[PHY-P2-3] [high]** Info-modal "Concept" text is stale versus the applied PHY-P2-1 / PHY-P2-2 fixes. Line 341 still reads "τ⁺τ⁻ opens at √s ≥ 2m_τ ≈ 3.55 GeV" while card 3's on-screen chip and feedback now display 3.554 GeV; line 339 still reads "s·σ = (4πα²/3)(ħc)² = 86.85 nb·GeV² is constant in √s" without the "(massless limit)" caveat that PHY-P2-1 added to the band chip. The claim is only exact for m_f → 0 (μμ at √s = 1 GeV gives s·σ = 86.79, a 0.07% shortfall from the muon-mass factor). Evidence: `fds-rev2-info-modal-1440.jpg`; anchor `#shell-info-modal` L339 & L341. → **Fix:** append " (massless limit)" to the s·σ = 86.85 clause on L339 and change "≈ 3.55 GeV" to "≈ 3.554 GeV" on L341 (or keep "≈ 3.55 GeV" if the ≈ is deemed to license the rounding — but pick one number and use it in all UI copy).

### NON-PHYSICS
#### P0   none
#### P1
- **[NP-P1-2] [inquiry] [high]** Card 5's predict-before-reveal is defeated whenever the student reaches the inquiry via the Lecture-OFF path (the primary entry, because the sim boots in Lecture per L734 curriculum request). `finishInquiry()` at boot runs `onComplete()` which sets `inqDone = true` (L1492) so σ, s·σ, the σ(√s) curve, the ◆ anchors, and the s·σ ring are all revealed. `setLectureMode(false)` reopens the inquiry at card 1 via `inqShow(0)` but does NOT clear `inqDone`. Paging (‹ ›) or Next→ to card 5 lands on μμ at √s = 3, and `updateAll()`'s `shown = D.pred !== null || inqDone` is already true → Result panel shows "σ = 9.650 nb / s·σ = 86.85 nb·GeV²" while card 5 still asks the student to *predict* what σ does when √s doubles and offers all three choices live-clickable. Repro (fresh boot, foreground tab, cleared localStorage): 🎓 Lecture click → ‹pager× 4 to card 5. Observed: roSig = "9.650 nb", roInv = "86.85 nb·GeV²", roLock display = "none", curve + s·σ line + ◆ anchors + "your ÷4" ghost from the pre-committed reveal all drawn; the whole card-5 pedagogy is dead on arrival. Evidence: `fds-rev2-card5-inqdone-reveal-1440.jpg` + JS state dump {`roSigC5: "9.650 nb", roInvC5: "86.85 nb·GeV²", choicesEnabled: [true,true,true]`}. Anchors: L734 `setLectureMode(true) /* curriculum request */`, L1491–1496 `onComplete` setting `inqDone`, L574 `setLectureMode(false)` reopen path. → **Fix:** in `setLectureMode(false)` (or in an "on-reopen" hook the sim can register), reset `inqDone = false` and clear `D.pred = null`, then call `updateAll()`; this is scoped to the reopen — the completed / free-exploration state after a real Finish (or an explicit Lecture toggle from within the inquiry) is unaffected. Alternative: gate `inqDone`'s reveal on "the student actually reached the completion path" rather than the boot fast-forward — e.g., only set it when finishInquiry runs *after* first user interaction with a `.choice`.
#### P2   none

## To verify (human)
- Tab-foregrounded HT boot state: the empty registry makes this invisible either way, but the HT-follows-lecture load hook uses two rAF frames (L414–418) and rAF is frozen while `document.hidden`, so the boot state of the `#ht-toggle` checkbox differs between backgrounded and foregrounded first-loads. No user-visible effect because registry is empty; flagged so the pattern doesn't get copied into a sim that DOES register items.
- NP-P1-2's fix option ("reset inqDone on Lecture-OFF reopen") should be checked against the "curriculum request" that motivated boot-in-Lecture — the curriculum owner may specifically want the completed state as the first thing a student sees, in which case card 5 needs a re-hide on reopen rather than an alternative default.
