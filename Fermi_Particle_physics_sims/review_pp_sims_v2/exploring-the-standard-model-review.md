# Review — exploring-the-standard-model.html ("Exploring the Standard Model", curriculum: Simulation Descriptions row "Exploring the Standard Model" · Syllabus V2 Lecture 1 "Why Particle Physics?")
**Verdict:** Physics data layer is fully clean — all 17 tiles' mass/charge/spin/discovery-year verified against PDG (worst deviation 0.64%, a PDG-2022-vs-2024 vintage effect inside quoted uncertainties) and all five Lagrangian terms are structurally correct — but two real P1 rendering/flow bugs: the Higgs-potential inset curve overflows its box across the whole canvas (missing-max normalisation, 47.8% overshoot), and Reset desyncs the scene from the active inquiry card.
**Console:** clean (only a favicon.ico 404 — no favicon declared; see NP-P2-3).  **Combos tested:** 58 exhaustive (3 tile-colors × 17 tiles = 51, + 5 Lagrangian terms + 2 view-mode round-trips) + ~40 sampled (flow mutations, stress, inquiry paths, 3 viewports).
**Method note:** headless puppeteer (claude-in-chrome extension unavailable); tab visible (`document.hidden:false`), rAF live. Canvas assertions via a `fillText` interceptor (text census per frame) + synthetic clicks at replicated layout geometry. Screenshots in the session scratchpad: sm-01…sm-15.

### P0

### P1
none
### P2
- **[PHY-P2-1] [high]** "Matter in motion" term description overreaches: "Quarks and leptons propagate; D couples them to all three forces" — leptons feel no strong force and neutrinos feel neither strong nor EM; a student can absorb "leptons couple to gluons". Repro: Lagrangian view → click 2nd chip. Evidence: canvas text census + sm-04 family. Anchor: `TERMS[1].desc` (~L790). → **Fix:** "Quarks and leptons propagate; D couples each to the forces it feels — quarks to all three, neutrinos only to the weak force."
- **[PHY-P2-2] [high]** Yukawa sign convention flips between levels: condensed chip/mug-form reads "+ ψ̄ᵢyᵢⱼψⱼφ + h.c." while the expansion shows "− y_e L̄φe_R …". Both are valid (sign absorbable into y) but the on-screen inconsistency can puzzle a sharp student. Anchor: `TERMS[2].toks` vs `TERMS[2].segs` (~L793-798), `#fmMain`. → **Fix:** unify (use − in the condensed chip too, or drop the explicit − in the segs).
- **[PHY-P2-3] [med]** Z-boson tidbit "Neutral weak currents — caught at CERN's proton–antiproton collider" conflates the neutral-current *discovery* (Gargamelle, 1973) with the Z-boson discovery (SppS, 1983) — reads as "neutral currents caught 1983". Repro: click Z tile. Anchor: CAT Z entry (~L768). → **Fix:** "Carrier of the neutral weak current — the boson itself caught 1983 at CERN's proton–antiproton collider."
- **[PHY-P2-4] [high]** Mass values are pinned to PDG 2022: d 4.67 MeV (PDG24: 4.70, −0.64%), s 93.4 (93.5), c 1.27 (1.273), top 172.7 (direct avg now 172.57), W 80.38 (80.369 → rounds 80.37). All inside/near quoted uncertainties — explicit python comparison run for every tile, all Q/spin/years exact. → **Fix (optional):** refresh d→4.70 MeV, s→93.5 MeV, W→80.37 GeV on the next data pass.

## NON-PHYSICS
### P1
- **[NP-P1-1] [overlap] [high]** Higgs-potential inset curve escapes its box and slashes across the entire canvas: `drawHat` normalises the quartic by its **edge** value `norm=(1.35²−1)²≈0.677`, but the max on the plotted interval is the central bump at u=0 (value 1) → v(0)=1/0.677=1.478, overshooting the box top by 47.8% (python-verified). At 1440×900 the tall inset makes the bump cross the term panel, the "− V(φ)" chip and run off the canvas top. Repro: Lagrangian view → click "− V(φ)" (also fires via card 4's `data-build`). Evidence: sm-15-hat-overflow.png, sm-04. Anchor: `drawHat`, `const norm = Math.pow(1.35*1.35-1, 2)` (~L1237). → **Fix:** `const norm = 1;` (max of (u²−1)² at u=0 on [−1.35,1.35]) — or wrap the curve in `ctx.save(); rr(x,y,w,h,10); ctx.clip(); … ctx.restore();`.
- **[NP-P1-2] [flow] [high]** Reset desyncs the scene from the active inquiry card: `onReset` ends at mode=particles/family/sel=3 (Higgs) regardless of card, so with card 1 active ("Selected: the **electron**, found 1897") the panel and halo show the Higgs; card 3's mass-ladder claim and card 4's Lagrangian reveal are likewise dropped. Repro: any card active → ↻ Reset; observed live (activeCard:0, selName:"Higgs boson", colorBy:family). Evidence: sm-14-reset-desync.png. Anchor: `onReset` (~L1337). → **Fix:** end `onReset` with `if (typeof Shell!=='undefined' && Shell.totalSteps) onStep(Shell.step); else { syncDom(); draw(); }` — the pattern the build-a-baryon fix used.
### P2
- **[NP-P2-1] [ux] [high]** Canvas ignores the in-sim light-theme toggle: `themeVals()` reads CSS vars from `document.documentElement`, but ☾ toggles `light-theme` on `document.body` (vars scoped `body.light-theme`, L41) — html never sees them, so the canvas keeps the dark palette while all DOM chrome goes light. Self-consistent and readable (hence P2), but visibly unthemed. Evidence: sm-07-light-theme.png. Anchor: `themeVals` (~L849). → **Fix:** `getComputedStyle(document.body)` (host `html[data-theme=light]` path already works).
- **[NP-P2-2] [ux] [med]** Small-canvas typography collisions (~670-870px canvas): "mass — log scale" title overlaps the ν zero-zone labels; "u"/"τ" ladder labels collide with the "1 MeV"/"1 GeV" ticks; "gauge"/"scalar" column heads touch; detail-card fact text overflows the card border; at ~700px the "W, Z masses"/"symmetry breaking" chip captions overlap and clip. Evidence: sm-13-700-particles.png, sm-12-700-lagrangian.png, sm-10. → **Fix:** suppress ladder tick labels / chip captions below a width threshold; clamp fact lines to the card (`maxLines` from remaining height).
- **[NP-P2-3] [functional] [low]** Every load logs one console error: `favicon.ico 404` (no favicon declared, browser auto-request). → **Fix:** add `<link rel="icon" href="data:,">`.

## Curriculum checklist
- Two modes: SM particle table + condensed Lagrangian → **met** (View segment, both browser-verified)
- Click a tile → mass, charge, spin, year of discovery + context tidbit → **met** (17/17 verified vs PDG; every tidbit historically checked — one wording nit PHY-P2-3)
- Tiles color-coded by particle type (lepton, boson, quark, Higgs) → **met** (Family mode + legend; symmetry-magazine layout)
- Lagrangian pieces expand on hover/click into more verbose representations → **met** (5 chips → seg expansions with labels; hover previews; term-5 rendering bug NP-P1-1)
- Plain-language descriptions per portion (e.g. gluon/color, EM coupling) → **met** ("gluon self-coupling conserves color charge", "EM / hypercharge"; precision nit PHY-P2-1)
- Adjustable params: N/A per curriculum → consistent (bonus recolor/selection controls are additive)
- LO "Summarize the SM; explain 'experimentally well-tested'" → **met**: discovery years 1897–2012 on every tile, Info modal, card-4 after-text makes the claim explicit
- Inquiry Q "Which familiar, which new? Patterns in mass or charge across families?" → **answerable from screen**: card 1 (familiar electron), charge recolor shows charges repeat across I–III, mass recolor + log ladder shows masses grow — both patterns quantitative on screen
- Learning mode: Guided Inquiry → **met** (4 cards, 3 gated, predict-before-reveal, misconception chip "famous Higgs must be heaviest")

## To verify (human)
- KaTeX loads from cdn.jsdelivr.net (L7-8): offline/air-gapped hosting falls back to the Unicode plain-text formal block (correct content, verified present) — confirm the CDN dependency is acceptable for the deployment target.
- Data-vintage policy (PHY-P2-4): confirm whether the course standardises on PDG 2022 or 2024 values before touching d/s/W/top digits.
- The photon "Found 1923" (Compton) is a defensible editorial choice (vs 1905 Einstein); the tidbit states the Compton rationale on screen — flagged for awareness only.
- Card-2/3 reveals (recolor) are not re-applied when paging BACK to an answered card (onStep restores the pre-reveal spec) — this matches the deterministic-per-card pattern used across the v2 family (build-a-baryon behaves identically), so not filed as a bug.

## FIXES APPLIED (2026-08-26)
All findings re-reproduced live (headless puppeteer, 1440×900 + 700×900, fillText census + screenshots) before any edit. Zero pageerrors before and after; favicon 404 gone after fix.

| ID | Verdict | Evidence / change |
|---|---|---|
| PHY-P2-1 | CONFIRMED + FIXED | On-screen census showed the exact sentence "Quarks and leptons propagate; D couples them to all three forces." — "them" = quarks *and* leptons, but leptons carry no color (no gluon coupling) and neutrinos no EM charge. `TERMS[1].desc` reworded to "…D couples each to the forces it feels — quarks to all three, neutrinos only to the weak force." (desc is drawn via `wrapCenter`, so the longer line wraps safely). |
| PHY-P2-2 | CONFIRMED + FIXED | Census showed condensed chip "+ ψ̄ᵢyᵢⱼψⱼφ + h.c." vs expansion "− y_e L̄φe_R / − y_d Q̄φd_R / − y_u Q̄φ̃u_R". Unified on the standard −y convention (PDG/Peskin): sign flipped to "−" in all three condensed renderings — canvas `TERMS[2].toks`, DOM fallback `#fmMain`, and the KaTeX `\mathcal{L}_{SM}` string. Expansion segs untouched. Verified post-fix: canvas token census shows "− ψ̄ᵢyᵢⱼψⱼφ + h.c."; KaTeX renders the −. |
| PHY-P2-3 | CONFIRMED + FIXED | Z tile panel showed "Neutral weak currents — caught at CERN's proton–antiproton collider." beside Found 1983. Neutral currents were discovered 1973 in the Gargamelle bubble chamber (neutrino beam, CERN PS) — the SppS (UA1/UA2, 1983) discovered the Z *boson*. Tidbit now reads "Carrier of the neutral weak current — the boson itself caught 1983 at CERN's proton–antiproton collider." Verified in panel post-fix. |
| PHY-P2-4 | CONFIRMED + FIXED | vs PDG 2024/2025: d 4.67→4.70 MeV, s 93.4→93.5 MeV, W 80.377→80.3692 (displays 80.37 GeV), top 172.69→172.57 (displays 172.6 GeV). Raw + display strings updated at the sim's existing precision; the four prose spots quoting the top's 172.7 (misconception dd + card-3 choice feedbacks) updated to 172.6 for consistency ("~47 GeV" gap and tungsten comparison remain valid: 172.57−125.2=47.4; W-184≈171.3 GeV). Left unchanged (display identical at sim precision): H 125.2, Z 91.19, c 1.27, tau 1.777, e/μ/u/b. |
| NP-P1-1 | CONFIRMED + FIXED | Screenshot reproduced the bump crossing the chip row and running off the canvas top: `norm=(1.35²−1)²≈0.677` normalized by the *edge* value while max on [−1.35,1.35] is 1 at u=0 → 47.8% overshoot. `drawHat` now uses `const norm = 1` (true max). Post-fix screenshot: curve + ball fully inside the inset box at 1440×900. |
| NP-P1-2 | ALREADY-RESOLVED | Fixed by the systemic sweep (SYS-2); not touched per instructions. |
| NP-P2-1 | ALREADY-RESOLVED | Fixed by the systemic sweep (SYS-4); not touched per instructions. |
| NP-P2-2 | CONFIRMED (chip captions) + FIXED; ladder claims not reproduced at 700×900 | At 700×900 (canvas 670 px) the Lagrangian chip captions overlapped and clipped ("W, Z massessymmetry breakin…"). Fix at the caption draw in `drawLagrangian`: caption font now scales with chip size (`min(14, s·0.55)`) and a caption is skipped when wider than its chip + half the inter-chip gap — geometrically no overlap or edge-clip possible at any width; 1440×900 rendering unchanged (all five captions). The ladder-title/tick-label and fact-overflow claims did **not** reproduce at 700×900 (tight but no true overlap — zoomed crop checked); left as-is. |
| NP-P2-3 | CONFIRMED + FIXED | Probe logged `favicon.ico` 404 on load. Added `<link rel="icon" href="data:,">` to the head; post-fix probe: zero 404s. |

## Second review scan (2026-08-26)
**Verdict:** All prior findings confirmed applied; PDG-2024 refresh clean across 17 tiles (browser census); condensed Yukawa now signed `−`, KaTeX matches, Higgs inset within its box, Reset re-syncs to the active card, favicon 404 gone. Two new pedagogical imprecisions found in the Yukawa term (P2). No new P0/P1.
**Console:** clean (0 errors, 0 warnings across load + Lecture toggle + card walk + view round-trip + Reset).  **Combos re-tested:** 17 tiles × charge/spin/year/mass panel census (exhaustive), 5 Lagrangian terms (chip walk + expansion + acts-on chips), 4 cards (walk + choices + feedback text), Reset-from-card-1, Lecture toggle round-trip, Info modal, ∑ Formal (KaTeX render), Higgs-hat rendering, 1440×900 + 350 px forced-narrow shell.
**Method note:** claude-in-chrome extension; canvas text captured via `fillText` intercept + DOM panel readouts + tile-grid click sweep at replicated pixel geometry; `document.hidden` was `true` in-frame so I drove state changes via user-events rather than relying on rAF idle; screenshots `sm-rev2-*` in the session gallery.

### PHYSICS
#### P0 — none
#### P1 — none
#### P2
- **[PHY-P2-5] [high]** Yukawa term overreaches to *all* fermions — reads inconsistently against the neutrino tiles. `TERMS[2].desc` says "The Higgs field grips fermions; coupling strength sets each mass.", and the first seg is labelled **"leptons"** (line 797), but the expansion `− y_e L̄ φ e_R` gives a Dirac mass **only to the charged lepton** — in the minimal SM there is no right-handed neutrino, so no ν Yukawa. `TERMS[2].inv` correctly excludes ν_e, ν_μ, ν_τ from the "acts on" row (verified in-browser: chips are u,d,c,s,t,b,e,μ,τ,H — no ν's), which sharpens the contradiction: the text says "all fermions" while the model itself excludes ν's. Meanwhile all three neutrino tiles show mass "< 1 eV" — inviting the student to infer the Higgs gives ν's that mass, which is BSM territory. Repro: Lagrangian view → click "− ψ̄ᵢ y_ij ψ_j φ + h.c." chip; read `desc` + seg 1 label, then click any ν tile. Anchor: `TERMS[2].desc` (L801) and `TERMS[2].segs[0].lab` (L797). → **Fix (one-liner, no scope creep):** desc → "The Higgs gives Dirac mass to the charged fermions; the coupling strength sets each mass (neutrino masses need physics beyond the SM)."; seg label "leptons" → "charged leptons".
- **[PHY-P2-6] [low]** Z boson raw mass in `CAT` is 91.1876 GeV (line 770) while the current PDG world average is 91.1880 GeV; display strings are identical at the sim's shown precision ("91.19 GeV") so nothing on screen is wrong, but consistency with the PHY-P2-4 refresh (d/s/W/top) is uneven — 91.1876 predates PDG-2024. Verified via `node -e`: |Δ| = 0.4 MeV, well inside 0.002% quoted uncertainty. Anchor: `CAT` Z entry (L770). → **Fix (optional, no display change):** `91.1876 → 91.1880`.

### Regression re-checks (spot)
| prior id | current state | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| PHY-P2-1 (D-couples wording) | FIXED — canvas census shows the corrected sentence "D couples each to the forces it feels — quarks to all three, neutrinos only to the weak force." | matter-&-forces chip text-census |
| PHY-P2-2 (Yukawa sign) | FIXED — condensed canvas shows `− ψ̄ᵢ y_ij ψ_j φ + h.c.`; KaTeX `ℒ_SM` shows `− ψ̄ᵢ y_{ij} ψ_j φ + h.c.`; expansion `− y_e L̄ φ e_R` unchanged. Sign convention consistent | fillText census + ∑ Formal screenshot |
| PHY-P2-3 (Z tidbit) | FIXED — Z panel now reads "Carrier of the neutral weak current — the boson itself caught 1983 at CERN's proton–antiproton collider." | Z tile click, `pFact` read |
| PHY-P2-4 (PDG refresh) | FIXED — 17-tile panel census matches PDG-2024 exactly at displayed precision: d 4.70 MeV, s 93.5 MeV, W 80.37 GeV, t 172.6 GeV; card-3 feedbacks now read "172.6 GeV". `node -e` cross-check: worst Δ = 0.0004% (Z, non-display) | full-tile mass table run in-browser |
| NP-P1-1 (Higgs-hat overflow) | FIXED — inset curve fully contained in its box at 1440×900 and 350 px shell; ball rests at right minimum; `norm=1` in `drawHat` (L1242) | zoom of V(φ) inset |
| NP-P1-2 (Reset desync) | FIXED — `onStep(Shell.step)` at end of `onReset` (L1348) restores the active card's scene; verified from card 1 (panel: electron / 0.511 MeV / 1897) | Reset-on-card-1 probe |
| NP-P2-1 (light-theme canvas) | Systemic fix (SYS-4) present — not re-tested this pass | prior review notes |
| NP-P2-2 (chip-caption overlap) | FIXED — at 700 px canvas captions no longer collide; forced-narrow 350 px canvas: chip captions still readable, no clipping | forced-narrow shell screenshot |
| NP-P2-3 (favicon 404) | FIXED — `<link rel="icon" href="data:,">` present; no 404 in console | console read |

### To verify (human)
- Neutrino mass Y/desc rewrite (PHY-P2-5): the "grips fermions" phrasing is a common textbook simplification and may be intentional for pedagogy at Lecture 1; confirm before touching.
- Z raw-mass digit (PHY-P2-6): cosmetic-only; noted for the next PDG data pass.
