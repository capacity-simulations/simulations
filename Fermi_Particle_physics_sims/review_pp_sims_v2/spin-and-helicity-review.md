# Review — spin-and-helicity.html ("Spin & Helicity — Overtake an Electron", curriculum: Syllabus-brainstorm L6 "Solutions of the Dirac Equation" · Simulation Descriptions row "Spin and Helicity")
**Verdict:** Physics core is exact — 50/50 p×β grid combos match explicit `p′ = γ(p − βE)` calculations to the displayed digit, the flip/undefined window and chirality boost-invariance behave perfectly — but card 4's feedback prints a wrong β_e (0.99997; true value 0.99967, all three choices) and Reset desyncs the scene from the active inquiry card.
**Console:** clean — zero sim errors/pageerrors at every stage (one `/favicon.ico` 404 from the static file server; no sim asset involved).
**Combos tested:** 50 exhaustive (5 p × 10 β grid) + ~110 sampled (16-point flip scan, 3 jump chips + 10× repeat, flow mutations, 70-event scrub stress, 12 inquiry states).

**Curriculum note (required disclosure):** the curriculum row for this sim is SPARSE — Syllabus-brainstorm L6 gives only "Spin/helicity visualiser: adjust momentum to observe spin projection changing" + inquiry "Reflections on helicity"; the Simulation Descriptions row is one line. Per the skill's rule the LOs were **derived from the Info modal**: (1) helicity h = S·p̂ is frame-dependent for massive particles and flips under an overtaking boost (β > p/E); (2) chirality is frame-invariant, P_R,L = (1±β_e)/2; (3) helicity → chirality as E ≫ mc² (the meaning of "left-handed neutrino"). These match the skill canon's Helicity/chirality entry exactly.

**Review environment:** headless Chrome (puppeteer-core, 1440×900, `document.hidden = false`, rAF live — animation verified running, drift directions measured from live frames). Read-only: the sim file was not touched. Screenshots in the session scratchpad (`sh-initial/card2-revealed/card4-maxboost/reset-desync/formal-light/light-overtaken/…​.png`).

## PHYSICS
### P0   (wrong physics on screen: number, sign, trend, animation, or card/feedback text)
- **[PHY-P0-1] [high]** Card 4 feedback prints β_e = 0.99997 for the p = 20 MeV electron; the true value is p/E = 20/√(20² + 0.511²) = **0.999674** — the claim understates 1−β_e by ×10 (3×10⁻⁵ vs 3.26×10⁻⁴). Repro: card 4, click any choice. Observed: "β_e = 0.99997 sits beyond the slider" (correct-choice fb; the other two choices repeat the number). Evidence: `sh-card4-maxboost.png` + explicit python calc. The qualitative conclusion (flip out of the slider's reach; p′ bottoms at +0.11 MeV — verified: γ(20 − 0.9995·20.00653) = 0.1099 MeV) is unaffected. Anchor: the three `data-fb` strings, lines 454–456. → **Fix:** replace "0.99997" with "0.99967" (and "≈ 0.99997" with "≈ 0.99967") in all three feedbacks.
### P1   (physics gap/imprecision that can mislead)
- none
### P2   (physics polish: notation, sig-figs, edge-of-range inaccuracy)
- **[PHY-P2-1] [high]** The formal box and Info modal write the chiral fraction as P_R,L = (1±β)/2 with a bare β — the same symbol as the **observer boost** slider, whose whole lesson is that it does NOT move this quantity; cards 3–4 carefully write β_e. Repro: ∑ Formal → third box. Anchor: `eqC` KaTeX string L1070 + Info modal L350/363. → **Fix:** subscript it: `P_{R,L}=\dfrac{1\pm\beta_e}{2}` (and "(1±β_e)/2" in the modal).
- **[PHY-P2-2] [med]** At high p the sidebar "h flips at β =" shows **1.000** (toFixed(3) of 0.99967) and the flip tick clamps to 100% of the boost bar — visually placing the flip AT the slider's end while card 4 teaches it is beyond reach (and β = 1 is unphysical). Repro: p = 20 MeV. Evidence: `sh-card4-maxboost.png` (sidebar). Anchor: `flipLab … bP.toFixed(3)` / `flipTick … Math.min(100, …)` L1011–1012. → **Fix:** show 4 decimals when bP > 0.999 (0.9997) or render "> 0.9995 (off scale)" and park the tick just past the bar end.

## NON-PHYSICS
### P0   (dead control, crash, data-loss flow bug, broken gate/reveal, unusable overlap)
- none
### P1   (degraded flow, silent config reset, missing curriculum affordance, bad overlap)
- **[NP-P1-1] [flow] [high]** Reset desyncs the scene from the active inquiry card: `onReset` always applies the baseline `apply(1, 0)`, so with card 2/3/4 active the card's on-screen claims ("Overtaken at β = 0.9, h = −1"; "At p = 20 MeV… the bar ≈100% R") contradict the scene (p = 1 MeV, β = 0, h = +1, 94.5% R). Repro: reach card 4 → ↻ Reset. Observed live: active card = 4, readouts p 1.00 MeV / β 0.0000 / 94.5% (`sh-reset-desync.png`). Anchor: `onReset` L1084–1088. → **Fix:** after the baseline, re-apply the active card's spec when the inquiry is open — `if(!document.getElementById('shell').classList.contains('inquiry-collapsed')) onStep(Shell.step);` — the same pattern used to fix build-a-baryon (its NP-P1-1).
### P2   (polish, cosmetics, minor responsiveness)
- **[NP-P2-1] [cosmetic] [high]** Canvas chip shows "boost β = 1.000" at slider max (toFixed(3) of 0.9995) while the sidebar reads 0.9995 — an on-canvas β = 1 that never happened. Known issue, verified as shipped here. Repro: overtake chip. Evidence: `sh-card4-maxboost.png` / `sh-overtake-max.png` + fillText intercept ("boost β = 1.000"). Anchor: `chipBox(… state.betaObs.toFixed(3) …)` L979. → **Fix:** `toFixed(4)` on the chip (matches the sidebar) — also fixes "boost β = 0.891" at 0.8905.
- **[NP-P2-2] [ux] [med]** Light theme: the canvas keeps the DARK palette (dark chips, grey chirality panel, faint track) because `themeCols()` reads `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)` while the toggle sets `body.light-theme` — the overridden vars live on body, not html. Everything stays readable (verified `sh-light-overtaken.png`), just inconsistent. Anchor: `themeCols()` L798–807. → **Fix:** read `getComputedStyle(document.body)`.
- **[NP-P2-3] [ux] [low]** Scrubbing either slider auto-pauses the animation (`pauseForScrub` — deliberate, and the Play button visibly flips) but the three jump chips do not, and nothing resumes play afterwards; a student who scrubs once sees a static scene until they press ▶. Anchor: `pauseForScrub` L1037–1039 vs `setBeta` L1051. → **Fix (optional):** resume on `change` (slider release), or leave — but make chips and sliders consistent.

## Curriculum checklist
- "Adjust momentum to observe spin projection changing" (Syllabus-brainstorm L6 / Sim Descriptions) → **met**: p slider drives β_e, flip point, chirality bar; the spin arrow itself deliberately never moves — the momentum reversal changes h, which is the physically correct reading of the sparse row.
- Inquiry "Reflections on helicity" → **met**: cards 2–4 are precisely predict-commit reflections on helicity's frame-dependence, chirality's invariance, and the massless limit.
- Derived-LO 1 (h flips under overtaking boost, β > p/E) → **met** — flip scan + card 2 (canon: Helicity/chirality entry ✓).
- Derived-LO 2 (chirality boost-invariant, P_R = (1+β_e)/2) → **met** — rC identical across all 50 grid combos; card 3.
- Derived-LO 3 (helicity → chirality as E ≫ mc²; "left-handed neutrino") → **met** — card 4 + inq-after; numeric feedback flaw = PHY-P0-1.
- Guided Inquiry mode with gated predict-first cards → **met** (4 cards, 3 gated, optional — sim fully usable throughout).

## To verify (human)
- Fine print on "chirality is boost-invariant": rigorously, γ⁵ commutes with boosts so L/R components never mix, but the u†u-normalized weight of a helicity eigenstate is frame-dependent; the sim (and the course canon + standard texts) pins P_R,L to the electron's lab-frame β_e. This is the intended teaching — flagged only so a lecturer can decide whether a footnote is wanted.
- Sub-1000-px stacked layout and touch scrubbing were not exercised this run (1440×900 only; wide layout verified clean in dark and light screenshots).
- The favicon 404 is emitted by the plain http.server for every sim; confirm the deployment host serves one (cosmetic, console-noise only).

## FIXES APPLIED (2026-08-26)
Phase-1 reconfirmation: every finding re-reproduced in headless Chrome (1440×900, fresh loads, fillText intercept) and recomputed with node (m_e = 0.511 MeV) before any edit. Card 4's convention is momentum (prose: "At p = 20 MeV"), so β_e = 20/√(20² + 0.511²) = 0.999674 — the review's 0.99967 is correct under the sim's own convention (an E=20-total reading gives the same 0.99967; only T=20 would give 0.99969, and nothing in the sim says kinetic).

| ID | Verdict | Evidence / fix |
|---|---|---|
| PHY-P0-1 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | Live `.predict-eval` showed "β_e = 0.99997" (all 3 choices); node: p=20 → β = 0.999674. Fixed all three `data-fb` strings to 0.99967. Post-fix: `grep -c '0.99997'` = 0, `grep -c '0.99967'` = 3; all three feedbacks re-asserted on fresh loads. |
| PHY-P2-1 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | Sidebar slider "observer boost β" vs bare-β chiral fraction in ∑ Formal (`eqC` KaTeX L1071 + static fallback L502) and Info modal (L350, L363). All four now read β_e / β<sub>e</sub>; live DOM has zero remaining "(1±β)/2", KaTeX renders `\beta_e`. |
| PHY-P2-2 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | Live at p = 20.4 MeV: flipLab "1.000", tick clamped to 100% (slider max 0.9995 → flip shown as reachable). Fixed: `d.bP.toFixed(d.bP > 0.999 ? 4 : 3)` → flipLab now "0.9997" at high p ("0.890" at 1 MeV unchanged); card-4 prose "h flips at β = 1.000" updated to 0.9997 to stay in sync. Tick clamp left as-is (readout now unambiguous). |
| NP-P2-1 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | fillText intercept at slider max captured "boost β = 1.000" while sidebar read 0.9995. Chip `toFixed(3)` → `toFixed(4)` (L979); post-fix intercept captures "boost β = 0.9995". |
| NP-P2-3 | **CONFIRMED + FIXED** | Live: slider input → Shell.playing false; jump chip → stayed true. Added `pauseForScrub()` to the three chip click handlers (not inside `setBeta`, so card-reveal `setBeta` calls keep their behaviour). Post-fix: slider + all three chips pause consistently. |
| NP-P1-1 | **ALREADY-RESOLVED** | Fixed by the systemic sweep (SYS-2/SYS-4); not touched this pass. |
| NP-P2-2 | **ALREADY-RESOLVED** | Fixed by the systemic sweep (SYS-2/SYS-4); not touched this pass. |

Post-fix assertion run: zero pageerrors across all fresh loads; screenshots `sh-fix-final-card4.png`, `sh-fix-maxp-maxbeta.png` in the session scratchpad.

## Second review scan (2026-08-26)
Environment: headless Chrome (puppeteer-core, 1440×900, fresh loads), sim served at `http://localhost:8765/Sims_v2_lecture_versions/spin-and-helicity.html?v=rev2`. Zero sim pageerrors / zero console errors on every fresh load (one `/favicon.ico` 404 from the static server, unrelated to the sim asset). Read-only.

Reconfirmed fixed from the first pass (still in the file, verified live): PHY-P0-1 all three card-4 `data-fb` strings now read β_e = 0.99967 (grep-verified 3 hits, 0 hits of 0.99997); PHY-P2-1 formal `eqC` KaTeX renders `P_{R,L}=(1±β_e)/2` (line 1071) and the Info modal L350/L363 subscript β_e; PHY-P2-2 `flipLab` now shows 0.9997 at p = 20.4 MeV via `d.bP.toFixed(d.bP > 0.999 ? 4 : 3)` at L1011; NP-P2-1 canvas chip `toFixed(4)` at L980; NP-P2-3 pause-on-scrub parity on all three jump chips at L1057–1059. Physics re-verified on a fresh 50-combo p × β grid (5 × 10): chirality boost-invariance `rC` set-size = 1 for every p (perfect); `p′`, `E′`, `β_rel` string-match explicit `γ(p−βE)` node calculations to the displayed digit at (p, β) = (1, 0), (1, 0.5), (1, 0.9995), (20.4, 0), (20.4, 0.5), (20.4, 0.9995); 16-point flip scan at p = 1 MeV crosses +1 → undefined (0.890 / 0.8905 / 0.891) → −1 (from 0.8915) — exactly the discontinuous jump the sim promises.

**New finding — NON-PHYSICS P0.**

### NON-PHYSICS · P0
- **[NP-P0-1] [flow] [high]** ↻ Reset in the default free-exploration boot state silently applies **card 4's preset (p = 20.0 MeV, β = 0.9000)** instead of the [1 MeV, 0] baseline — the "Reset" button destroys the user's exploration state AND injects an inquiry preset the user never opted into. Repro (fresh load, no inquiry ever opened): boot state `shell.className = "hide-formal lecture-mode inquiry-collapsed hide-text"`, pVal 1.00 MeV, bVal 0.0000; nudge sliders to any values (e.g. p = 3.16 MeV, β = 0.3000); click `#shell-reset` → readouts jump to **pVal 20.0 MeV, bVal 0.9000** (100% reproducible over three fresh loads, including one with zero prior slider interaction). Evidence: `sh-rev2-t1-reset-immediate.png` (immediate reset from boot), `sh-rev2-t2-reset-after-tweak.png` (reset after slider tweak) — both land at 20.0 MeV / 0.9000. Root cause: the SYS-2 patch inserted `onStep(Shell.step)` inside `onReset` unconditionally (L1090), but on lecture-mode boot `Shell.step` is already at the fast-forward endpoint (last card = index 3), so `onStep(3)` runs the presets[3] = `apply(20, 0.9)` after the baseline `apply(1, 0)` — silently overriding it. The intended guard (the FIXES-APPLIED table's own reference implementation: `if(!document.getElementById('shell').classList.contains('inquiry-collapsed')) onStep(Shell.step);`) is missing. Anchor: `onReset` L1085–1091. → **Fix:** wrap L1090 in the class guard so the card re-sync only fires when the inquiry pane is actually open: `if(!document.getElementById('shell').classList.contains('inquiry-collapsed')) onStep(Shell.step);` — this preserves the NP-P1-1 fix (reset-during-open-card re-syncs the card scene) while restoring baseline Reset behaviour in the default and post-Finish free-exploration modes.

## To verify (human, second pass)
- The NP-P0-1 fix's after-state must be tested in three regimes: (a) fresh lecture-mode boot → Reset lands on [1, 0]; (b) inquiry-open on card N → Reset re-applies presets[N]; (c) post-Finish free exploration → Reset lands on [1, 0] (Shell.step being ≥ 3 after Finish is the same trap that surfaced this bug — the class-guard fix handles all three).
- No other new findings in this pass; the physics engine, chirality invariance, flip window, animation truth, curriculum coverage, inquiry gating/reveals, Hide Text, ∑ Formal, theme toggle, and pager round-trip all remain within their prior-review verdicts.
