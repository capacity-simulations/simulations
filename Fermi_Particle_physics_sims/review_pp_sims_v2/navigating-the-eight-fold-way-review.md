# Review — navigating-the-eight-fold-way.html ("Navigating the Eightfold Way", curriculum: Simulation Descriptions row "Navigating the Eight Fold Way" · Lecture 14 The Quark Model)
**Verdict:** Physics is fully clean — all 18 tiles verified against PDG (≤0.05% mass error), every tile position satisfies the (I₃, S) axes, GMN holds on every readout and diagonal, the Ω⁻ gap/reveal story is correct at (I₃ = 0, S = −3, Q = −1) — with only one historical-caption P2 and one inquiry-revisit P2 in polish.
**Console:** clean (zero JS errors across all runs; one favicon.ico 404 on first load only — browser chrome, not a sim asset).  **Combos tested:** 31 exhaustive (18 tile-node clicks + 17 tray-slot identities + gap before/after reveal + 12/12 discrete mode×qlines×arrangement×reveal states) + ~45 sampled (drags, flow mutations, stress).
**Method note:** reviewed headless (puppeteer-core, Chrome, 1440×900, page visible so rAF live); all dynamic claims browser-evidenced; PDG/GMN numbers checked by explicit python calc.

## PHYSICS
### P0
none
### P1
none
### P2
- **[PHY-P2-1] [high]** Λ⁰ tile note reads "≈1950 — first 'strange' particle"; the first strange particles were the 1947 Rochester–Butler V-particles (kaons) — the Λ (Hopper & Biswas, 1950) is the first strange **baryon**. Repro: click Λ⁰ (octet centre-right). Evidence: Particle card note (screenshot ew-01/02 run). Anchor: `TILES` entry `P('L0',…,'≈1950 — first “strange” particle.',0.24)` (~L784). → **Fix:** "≈1950 — first strange baryon."

## NON-PHYSICS
### P0
none
### P1
none
### P2
- **[NP-P2-1] [inquiry] [high]** Revisiting an **answered** reveal card re-applies its pre-answer scene: pager back to card 2 (answered, feedback "watch the dashed constant-Q diagonals appear" still shown) re-hides the diagonals; Reset on answered card 4 re-hides the Ω⁻ while the feedback "the Ω⁻ appears — measured 1672 MeV" stays visible. First-entry re-hide is the deliberate anti-spoiler (waived); the contradiction only exists for already-answered cards. Repro: answer card 2 → Next → ‹ back; or answer card 4 → Scatter → ↻ Reset. Evidence: pagerTrip (card idx 1 qlines:false with feedback shown) + ew-07-reset-card4.png. Anchor: `stepState(i)` (~L1166) ignores `card.dataset.answered`. → **Fix:** in `stepState`, if the target card has `dataset.answered`, re-apply its `data-reveal` (qlines → `state.qlines=true`; omega → `revealOmega()`).

## Control census
| control | range walked | observable asserted | verdict |

## Combination coverage manifest
| combo set | strategy | count | invariants asserted | result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tile-position ↔ identity | exhaustive | 18 (8 oct + 10 dec) | click at independently-computed (I₃,S) pixel node returns the right particle; card Q = I₃+(B+S)/2 = Σ quark charges; S = −(#s); masses ≤0.05% of PDG (python table in transcript) | 18/18 pass |
| Tray identities after scatter | exhaustive | 17 (9 dec + 8 oct) | every scattered tile present, clickable, card correct; Ω never in scatter set | pass |
| mode × qlines × arrangement × revealed | exhaustive over reachable states | 12 | fp changes with qlines both ways in both modes; gap iff dec+all-placed+unrevealed; hint text matches state; no NaN readouts | pass |
| Gap / reveal round trip | exhaustive | gap-click pre/post reveal + scatter→place-all→gap→click ×2 | reveal idempotent; gold pulse; Ω card 1672 MeV; re-scatter re-hides and replays | pass |
| Drag gestures | sampled | 6 (3 correct, 1 wrong-node, 1 tray-drop, 1 Ω-shelve) | correct → placed at node; wrong → red-X path, remains in tray, no tile loss; Place all restores Ω | pass |
| Flow mutations | sampled | scatter×mode-switch, qlines×mode, speed×mode, pause×interact, theme×state, maximize×state | nothing resets on unrelated control change (dec scatter survives oct round trip: 9/9 same tiles) | pass |

| Skipped (conscious) | — | drag-while-paused (isLive() teleport path, code-read only); per-tile drag of all 17 tiles (same pipeline as the 3 sampled, rest placed via Place all); <1000px responsive layout | — | noted |

## Inquiry-layer check

## Curriculum checklist
- "Sort particles by their symmetries" — tiles + scatter + drag-to-chart with accept/reject → **met**
- "Notice gaps that point to predicted particles; when students find a gap, the predicted (and later discovered) particle is revealed" — gap "?" appears on completing the decuplet; click reveals Ω⁻ with prediction/discovery story → **met**
- "Tiles for particles, space to sort them" → **met** (tray shelf + chart)
- "Additional information about prediction/discovery in a side panel when you click on the tile" → **met** (Particle card: Q, I₃, S, mass + discovery note, all PDG-verified)
- Learning mode: Guided Inquiry → **met** (4 cards, 3 gated, predict-before-reveal)
- Inquiry Qs "What patterns and symmetries help you sort? Do you notice any gaps? What might a gap represent?" → **answerable from screen**: S-coloured rows + constant-Q diagonals; pulsing "?" corner; gap card "Empty point — the pattern says a particle belongs here" + Ω⁻ reveal
- Lecture 14 "Patterns in charge and strangeness?" → **answerable**: Q constant on dashed diagonals (labelled −1…+2), S constant on rows, GMN in card 2/3 feedback and ∑ Formal
- L14 objective "Determine the allowed quark content of a baryon from its charge and strangeness" → **supported**: every tile shows quark content beside Q/I₃/S (deeper practice lives in build-a-baryon, per curriculum split)

## To verify (human)
- Σ⁰/Λ⁰ are drawn at I₃ ±0.24 horizontal offsets ("doubled centre" convention, explained in card 1 and Info) — standard textbook practice, accepted; confirm the lecturer is happy the offset never reads as I₃ ≠ 0 (the card readout always says I₃ = 0).
- Dragging a **placed** tile to a wrong/empty node sends it to the tray (not back to its node) — consistent staging-shelf behaviour, verified non-destructive; flagging only in case a "snap back to origin" feel is preferred.
- KaTeX loads from CDN (katex@0.16.9); offline the ∑ Formal panel falls back to correct plain-text equations (graceful, verified in code path) — confirm CDN use is acceptable for deployment.
- "Charge diagonals (constant Q)" checkbox label hints card 2's answer — waived by design (genuine control), per review brief.

## FIXES APPLIED (2026-08-26)
- **PHY-P2-1 — CONFIRMED + FIXED.** Source (`TILES` entry, L774) and live tile click (headless Chrome, octet mode, Λ⁰ at centre-right) both showed the note "≈1950 — first “strange” particle." Historically wrong: the first strange particles were the 1947 Rochester–Butler V-particles (neutral kaons); Λ⁰ (~1950, Hopper & Biswas) is the first strange **baryon**. Reworded to "≈1950 — first “strange” baryon (kaons, 1947, were the first strange particles)." — one-line change to the `P('L0',…)` note string. Verified live (?v=efwfix2): Λ⁰ card shows the new note, wraps to two lines inside the card with no overflow (scrollWidth==clientWidth, scrollHeight==clientHeight), zero pageerrors. Screenshot: efw-L0-card-efwfix2.png (scratchpad).
- NP-P2-1 not touched here — already fixed by the systemic sweep (SYS-5).

## Second review scan (2026-08-26)

**Verdict:** Clean rescan of rev2 — no new PHYSICS or NON-PHYSICS findings. The two prior fixes (PHY-P2-1 Λ⁰ wording + SYS-5 answered-card revisit) are live and behave as intended; every card, feedback string, ∑ Formal panel, GMN readout and Ω⁻ prediction still passes. **Console:** clean (zero pageerrors / console errors across load + full-flow + reset + sweep). **Combos tested:** 22 exhaustive (initial Lecture-ON completed state · Lecture-OFF card1 · card 2/3/4 forward + gate + reveal + feedback · card 4 → back to c2 (answered) → back to c1 → forward to c4 without re-answering · Reset while on card 4 · octet sweep (canvas) · decuplet sweep + Place all + Ω-reveal persistence · Hide-Text on/off · ∑ Formal open) + ~10 sampled (mode/qlines toggles interleaved).

**Method note:** headless puppeteer-core (Chrome 1440×900) against `http://localhost:8765/Sims_v2_lecture_versions/navigating-the-eight-fold-way.html?v=rev2`; screenshots `efw-rev2-*.png` in scratchpad. Curriculum-extract row "Navigating the Eight Fold Way" + Lecture 14 The Quark Model reconfirmed.

### Prior-finding verification (rev2)
- **PHY-P2-1 (Λ⁰ note wording) — VERIFIED FIXED.** Selecting Λ⁰ on the octet chart now shows "≈1950 — first "strange" baryon (kaons, 1947, were the first strange particles)." Source (TILES entry L774) matches. Two-line wrap inside the Particle card with no overflow. Evidence: `efw-rev2-rev2-02-lecture-off-card1.png`, `report2.json → afterLectureOff` (proton default) + prior L0 screenshot from rev1 commit.
- **NP-P2-1 (answered-card revisit re-hid the reveal) — VERIFIED FIXED (via SYS-5).** Sequence: Lecture OFF → card 1 → Next → answer card 2 correct (qlines on) → Next → answer card 3 correct → Next → answer card 4 correct (Ω⁻ revealed, mass 1672 MeV). ‹ ‹ back to answered card 2 → `qlinesChecked=true` (not re-hidden). Forward through c3, c4 without re-answering → qlines stays on, Ω⁻ stays revealed. Reset on card 4 → still dec mode + qlines on + Ω⁻ revealed (Reset re-syncs to the answered spec, per SYS-5 `onStep` path). Evidence: `report2.json → card2_onRevisit / c3fwd / c4fwd / afterResetCard4` + `efw-rev2-rev2-06-back-c2-answered.png`, `efw-rev2-rev2-09-reset-card4.png`.

### Physics spot-checks (rev2)
- Card 2 correct feedback: "Q = ½ + (1−2)/2 = 0" for Ξ⁰ (uss, B=1, S=−2). Verified: 0.5 + (−1)/2 = 0. ✓
- Card 3 correct feedback: "Q = 0 + (1−3)/2 = −1" for Ω⁻ (sss, B=1, S=−3, I₃=0). Verified: 0 + (−2)/2 = −1. ✓
- Card 4 mass-ladder feedback: 1533 + ≈147 → 1680 MeV published 1962; measured 1672 MeV (Brookhaven 1964). Matches PDG (Ω⁻ = 1672.45 MeV) and the standard Gell-Mann prediction narrative. ✓
- ∑ Formal panel (rev2 screenshot): `Q = I₃ + (B+S)/2  (B=1 for baryons)`, `m_Δ=1232, m_Σ*=1385, m_Ξ*=1533 ⇒ m_Ω ≈ 1680 MeV`, "Ω⁻ measured: 1672 MeV". All consistent with sim tile values and PDG. ✓
- Q-diagonal labelling on both charts (rev2): octet shows Q=−1, 0, +1; decuplet adds Q=+2. Correct: +2 requires I₃=+3/2 at S=0 which is only in the decuplet (Δ⁺⁺). ✓
- Λ⁰/Σ⁰ visual doubling on octet centre (offsets ±0.24) still labelled I₃=0 in the Particle card — verified via successive clicks at the two offset positions. ✓

### To verify (human)
- No new items; the four caveats from the first review remain accepted as designed.
