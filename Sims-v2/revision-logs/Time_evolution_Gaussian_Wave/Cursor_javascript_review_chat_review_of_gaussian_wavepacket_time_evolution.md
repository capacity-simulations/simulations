Implementing the three fixes from the plan. Checking current todos and applying edits.



Applying all three fixes.



Summary of what was implemented:

**1. Spreading parameter (Bug 1)**  
In `computeWavefunction()`:
- **Before:** `const sigmaT_re = sigma2;`
- **After:** `const sigmaT_re = 2 * sigma2;`  
So α(t) now has real part 2σ², giving the correct initial width σ for |ψ|² and correct spreading.

**2. Normalization (Bug 2)**  
In `computeWavefunction()`:
- **Before:** `norm_mag = Math.pow(2 * Math.PI * sigma2, 0.25) / Math.pow(denom, 0.25)`
- **After:** `norm_mag = 1.0 / (Math.pow(2 * Math.PI * sigma2, 0.25) * Math.pow(denom, 0.25))`  
So the prefactor is (2π σ²)^(−1/4) / |α(t)|^(1/2) and the wavefunction stays normalized.

**3. About equation (Bug 3)**  
In `renderAboutEquations()`:
- **Before:** `'\\alpha(t) = \\sigma^2 + \\frac{it}{m}'`
- **After:** `'\\alpha(t) = 2\\sigma^2 + \\frac{it}{m}'`  
The About section now shows the correct α(t) formula.

No linter issues were reported. The simulation should now have correct initial width σ, correct spreading, norm ≈ 1, and the About text matches the implementation.

## Physics review: Time_evolution_Gaussian_wavepacket_v2.html

### 1. Time evolution and formulas (all correct)

- **Complex width**  
  `sigmaT_re = 2 * sigma2`, `sigmaT_im = hbar * t / mass`  
  → α(t) = 2σ² + i ℏt/m (ℏ=1). Correct for standard Gaussian with position uncertainty σ at t=0.

- **Inverse 1/α**  
  `denom = sigmaT_re² + sigmaT_im²`,  
  `invSigmaT_re = sigmaT_re/denom`, `invSigmaT_im = -sigmaT_im/denom`  
  → Correct complex inverse.

- **Spatial Gaussian**  
  `expArg_re = -0.5 * x_shifted² * invSigmaT_re`,  
  `expArg_im = -0.5 * x_shifted² * invSigmaT_im`  
  → Exponent is −(x − x₀ − v_g t)²/(2α(t)). Correct.

- **Phase**  
  `phase = k0*(x - x0) - hbar*k0*k0*t/(2*mass)`  
  → k₀(x − x₀) − E t/ℏ with E = ℏ²k₀²/(2m). Correct.

- **Normalization**  
  `norm_mag = 1.0 / (Math.pow(2*Math.PI*sigma2,0.25)*Math.pow(denom,0.25))`  
  → |N(t)| = (2π σ²)^(−1/4) / |α(t)|^(1/2). Correct.

- **Norm phase**  
  `norm_phase = -0.5 * Math.atan2(sigmaT_im, sigmaT_re)`  
  → −½ arg(α(t)). Correct.

- **Group and phase velocity**  
  `vg = hbar*k0/mass`, `vp = hbar*k0/(2*mass)`  
  → v_g = ℏk₀/m, v_phase = ℏk₀/(2m). Correct.

- **About equations**  
  ψ exponent with 2α(t) in denominator and α(t) = 2σ² + it/m are consistent with the code.

---

### 2. Expectation values and stats (all correct)

- **Probability density**  
  `prob = psi.re*psi.re + psi.im*psi.im` → |ψ|². Correct.

- **Norm (integral of |ψ|²)**  
  `totalProb += prob * dx` over the grid. Correct; with the current normalization it should stay ≈ 1 for a packet well inside the domain.

- **⟨x⟩**  
  `meanX = Σ x·|ψ|²·dx / totalProb`. Correct.

- **Variance and Δx**  
  `variance = Σ (x - meanX)²·|ψ|²·dx / totalProb`, `spread = sqrt(variance)`. Correct for position uncertainty Δx.

---

### 3. Bugs and fixes

**No further bugs found** in the equations or concepts. The three items from the earlier plan are already implemented:

1. Spreading parameter: `sigmaT_re = 2 * sigma2`.
2. Normalization: `norm_mag = 1.0 / (Math.pow(2*Math.PI*sigma2,0.25)*Math.pow(denom,0.25))`.
3. About equation: α(t) = 2σ² + it/m.

No additional code changes are required for physics correctness.

---

### 4. Optional / caveats (not bugs)

- **About formula**  
  The displayed exponent ends with “+ i k₀ x”; the full phase is k₀(x − x₀) − ωt. The time-dependent part is effectively in N(t) and α(t), so the display is an acceptable shorthand. Optionally you could add a short note that the full phase includes −ωt.

- **Finite domain**  
  The grid is x ∈ [-40, 60] with fixed boundaries. If the packet moves near or past the edges, the numerical integral of |ψ|² (and thus Norm, ⟨x⟩, Δx) can deviate slightly from the ideal infinite-domain values. This is a numerical limitation, not an equation error.

---

**Summary:** All physics equations and concepts in the simulation are correct and consistent with the standard free Gaussian wavepacket in 1D (atomic units). The three previously identified bugs are fixed; there are no remaining physics bugs to fix.

Implementing the plan's recommended fix: adding a guard in `drawPlot` to skip drawing when `plotW` or `plotH` is non-positive.



Summary of what was implemented:

**Change made (from plan):**

- **Guard in `drawPlot`**  
  In [Time_evolution_Gaussian_wavepacket_v2.html](simulations/Sims-v2/Time_evolution_Gaussian_wavepacket_v2.html), right after `plotW` and `plotH` are computed, added:
  - `if (plotW <= 0 || plotH <= 0) return;`  
  So when the plot container has zero or very small size (e.g. collapsed or not yet laid out), the function exits and no drawing or gradient creation is done, avoiding negative plot dimensions and invalid canvas operations.

The optional “first-frame dt” tweak was not implemented, as the plan stated it is not required for correctness. No linter issues were reported.

## Final physics sanity check – Time_evolution_Gaussian_wavepacket_v2.html

### 1. Physics equations and concepts

| Item | Implementation | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Complex width α(t)** | `sigmaT_re = 2 * sigma2`, `sigmaT_im = hbar * t / mass` → α = 2σ² + iℏt/m | Correct |
| **1/α** | `denom = sigmaT_re² + sigmaT_im²`, `invSigmaT_re/im` = (Re(α), −Im(α))/denom | Correct |
| **Gaussian exponent** | `expArg_re/im = -0.5 * x_shifted² * invSigmaT_re/im` → −(x−x₀−v_g t)²/(2α) | Correct |
| **Phase** | `phase = k0*(x-x0) - hbar*k0*k0*t/(2*mass)` → k₀(x−x₀) − ωt | Correct |
| **Normalization** | `norm_mag = 1/((2πσ²)^(1/4) * denom^(1/4))`, `norm_phase = -½ arg(α)` | Correct |
| **Group / phase velocity** | `vg = hbar*k0/mass`, `vp = hbar*k0/(2*mass)` | Correct |
| **Probability** | `prob = psi.re² + psi.im²` | Correct |
| **⟨x⟩** | `meanX = Σ x·|ψ|²·dx / totalProb` | Correct |
| **Δx (spread)** | `variance = Σ (x−meanX)²·|ψ|²·dx / totalProb`, `spread = √variance` | Correct |
| **About equations** | ψ exponent with 2α(t); α(t) = 2σ² + it/m | Correct |

Atomic units (ℏ = 1) are used consistently. No physics bugs found.

---

### 2. Architecture and flow

- **Loop:** Single `requestAnimationFrame(animate)`; each frame: dt → advance `simTime` (if playing) → sample ψ on grid → compute stats → draw both plots and update DOM.
- **State:** Only `x0`, `k0`, `sigma`, `mass`, `timeSpeed`, `simTime`, `showReal`, `showImag`; no redundant or inconsistent state.
- **Grid:** Fixed `xMin=-40`, `xMax=60`, `numPoints=1200`, `dx = 100/1199`; same grid for integration and drawing.

No architecture bugs found.

---

### 3. Numerical methods

- **Time:** Analytical ψ(x,t); `simTime += clampedDt * timeSpeed` with `clampedDt = min(dt, 0.1)`.
- **Integration:** Rectangle rule for norm, ⟨x⟩, variance; stable (no overflow/divide-by-zero from formulas).
- **Sampling:** `x_i = xMin + i*dx`, i = 0..numPoints−1.

No numerical bugs found.

---

### 4. Animation and time

- `dt = (timestamp - lastTime)/1000`, then `lastTime = timestamp`; clamping to 0.1 s; pause and `timeSpeed = 0` behave correctly.

No animation/time bugs found.

---

### 5. Front-end and rendering

- **DPR:** Canvas size and `setTransform(dpr,...)`; `drawPlot` uses logical size `w = canvas.width/dpr`, etc.
- **World → pixel:** Index 0 → left, last → right; `val = yRange[0]` → bottom, `yRange[1]` → top.
- **Zero line:** `zeroY = margin.top + plotH * (yRange[1]/(yRange[1]-yRange[0]))` gives correct y for value 0.
- **Guard:** `if (plotW <= 0 || plotH <= 0) return;` is present after computing `plotW` and `plotH`.
- **Ranges:** `yMaxRI = Math.max(maxReal, maxImag, 0.1)*1.3`, `yMaxP = Math.max(maxProb, 0.01)*1.2` so no division by zero in y mapping.
- **Context:** `globalAlpha` and `shadowBlur` reset after glow; separate contexts per canvas.

No rendering bugs found.

---

### 6. Summary

- **Physics:** All equations and concepts checked; matches standard free Gaussian wavepacket in 1D (atomic units).
- **Architecture / numerics / animation / rendering:** Consistent and correct; plot-size guard in place; no remaining bugs identified.

**No further changes are required** for physics, architecture, numerics, or visuals based on this review.
