Bug 1 fixed. Summary of changes:

## Bug 1 Fix: Velocity-Based Deflection

### Changes Made:

1. Reset vertical velocity on stage entry (line 1417):
   - Added `this.vy = 0;` when entering a new deflection region

2. Replaced position-based deflection with velocity integration (lines 1420-1457):
   - Removed: Direct position manipulation with quadratic easing
   - Added: Proper velocity integration using acceleration

3. Physics implementation:
   - Calculates acceleration based on target deflection and travel time
   - Integrates velocity: `this.vy += acceleration * dtScale`
   - Integrates position: `this.y += this.vy * dtScale`
   - Frame-rate independent using `dtScale`

4. Behavior after deflection:
   - Particles maintain their velocity after leaving the field (physically correct)

### Improvements:

- Physics accuracy: Matches real Stern-Gerlach physics with proper acceleration/velocity integration
- Frame-rate independence: Deflection speed is consistent across different frame rates
- Visual consistency: Maintains the same target deflection amounts while using correct physics

The fix maintains the same visual appearance (same deflection amounts) while using proper kinematic physics. The acceleration is calculated to ensure particles reach the target deflection at the end of the deflection region, matching the previous visual behavior but with correct physics.

No linting errors detected. The code is ready to test.

Bug 4 fix complete. Summary:

## Bug 4 Fix: Missing Horizontal Deflection for X-Axis

### Changes Made:

1. Added horizontal deflection tracking (line 1357):
   - Added `this.horizontalDeflectionOffset = 0;` to track horizontal deflection separately

2. Initialize horizontal deflection on stage entry (line 1416):
   - Reset `horizontalDeflectionOffset` to 0 when entering a new deflection region
   - Store `stageDeflectionStartX[i]` for reference

3. Modified deflection logic (lines 1422-1457):
   - Calculate progress based on base x position (without horizontal deflection offset)
   - For X-axis measurements: Calculate horizontal deflection and apply it to x position
   - For Z-axis measurements: Keep existing vertical deflection behavior

4. Updated velocity integration (lines 1488-1504):
   - For X-axis deflection: Update base position, then reapply deflection offset
   - For Z-axis or no deflection: Normal velocity update

5. Fixed blocker detection (lines 1461-1464):
   - Use base x position (without horizontal deflection) for blocker position checks

6. Reset offset on exit (lines 1468-1471):
   - Reset `horizontalDeflectionOffset` when leaving deflection region

### Improvements:

- Visual correctness: X-axis measurements now deflect horizontally (left/right)
- Physics accuracy: Horizontal deflection works with the existing deflection system
- Proper separation: X-axis particles separate horizontally, Z-axis particles separate vertically
- No conflicts: Horizontal deflection doesn't interfere with velocity updates or progress calculations

### How It Works:

- X-axis measurements: Particles deflect horizontally based on spin value (positive = right, negative = left)
- Z-axis measurements: Particles deflect vertically (existing behavior, positive = up, negative = down)
- The horizontal deflection offset is tracked separately to avoid feedback loops in progress calculations
- Velocity updates correctly account for horizontal deflection by updating the base position and reapplying the offset

The fix ensures that X-axis Stern-Gerlach measurements visually separate particles horizontally, matching the physics where X-axis measurements should show horizontal beam splitting.

No linting errors detected. The code is ready to test.

Make the setup 360 degree drag and rotatable so that the horizontal splitting can be visualized.

---

**Cursor**

### Short answer

To make the setup 360° rotatable so horizontal splitting can be visualized cleanly, you want to treat the beam geometry in 3D and then project it into the 2D canvas with a user‑controlled view angle.

Below is a concrete way to do it that fits the existing code structure.

---

### 1. Add 3D state to each atom

In `class Atom` add explicit “world” coordinates; keep `x`/`y` as *screen* coords only:

```javascript
// inside constructor
this.worldX = 0;        // along beam (current x-axis)
this.worldY = 0;        // vertical deflection (current y-axis)
this.worldZ = 0;        // NEW: horizontal deflection axis

// initialize from current spawn position:
this.worldX = 0;        // define source as x=0
this.worldY = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 6 * scaleFactor;
this.worldZ = 0;
```

Then, everywhere you currently change `this.x`/`this.y` for physics, change it to `this.worldX` / `this.worldY` / `this.worldZ`:

- Beam forward motion: update `this.worldX` instead of `this.x`.
- Z‑axis Stern–Gerlach deflection: change `this.y = ...` → `this.worldY = ...`.
- X‑axis Stern–Gerlach deflection (your Bug‑4 fix): change the logic so it **only** sets `this.worldZ` instead of modifying `this.x`:

```javascript
if (stage.axis === 'x') {
    const horizontalDeflection = this.spinValue * stageDeflection * easedProgress;
    this.worldZ = horizontalDeflection;
} else {
    const verticalDeflection = this.spinValue * stageDeflection * easedProgress;
    this.worldY = this.stageDeflectionStartY[i] - verticalDeflection;
}
```

Your `update` method should now work purely in `worldX/worldY/worldZ`. The on‑screen `x`/`y` will be computed in the draw step (next section).

---

### 2. Add a view angle and drag controls

Near your globals:

```javascript
let viewAngle = 0;           // radians, rotation around beam axis
let isDraggingView = false;
let lastDragX = 0;
```

Attach mouse events on the canvas (or `#canvas-container`):

```javascript
const container = document.getElementById('canvas-container');

container.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
    isDraggingView = true;
    lastDragX = e.clientX;
});

window.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    if (!isDraggingView) return;
    const dx = e.clientX - lastDragX;
    lastDragX = e.clientX;
    const sensitivity = 0.005;           // tune
    viewAngle += dx * sensitivity;       // 360° drag
});

window.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
    isDraggingView = false;
});
```

You can also clamp or wrap `viewAngle` to `[-Math.PI, Math.PI]` if desired.

---

### 3. Project 3D → 2D when drawing atoms

At the start of `Atom.draw()` (and similarly wherever you draw trails / detection spots that depend on position), compute screen `x` / `y` from `worldX/worldY/worldZ` using a simple perspective around the beam axis:

Assume beam direction is horizontal (current x‑axis), so we rotate the transverse (Y,Z) plane by `viewAngle`:

\[
Y' = Y \cos\theta - Z \sin\theta \\
Z' = Y \sin\theta + Z \cos\theta
\]

Use \(Y'\) as vertical on screen; optionally use \(Z'\) for a slight depth effect (scale or darken):

```javascript
draw() {
    const color = this.getColor();

    // Rotate transverse plane around beam axis by viewAngle
    const cosA = Math.cos(viewAngle);
    const sinA = Math.sin(viewAngle);

    const rotatedY = this.worldY * cosA - this.worldZ * sinA;
    const rotatedZ = this.worldY * sinA + this.worldZ * cosA;

    // Map worldX (along beam) to screen X; rotatedY to screen Y
    const screenX = sourceX + this.worldX;          // unchanged beam direction
    const screenY = centerY + rotatedY;

    // Optional: depth cue from rotatedZ (slight scale / alpha tweak)
    const depthScale = 1 + (rotatedZ / (200 * scaleFactor)); // small effect
    const size = this.size * depthScale;

    // Use screenX/screenY/size instead of this.x/this.y/this.size
    // Trails: project each trail point the same way using stored worldY/worldZ

    // example core draw:
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(screenX, screenY, size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    ctx.fillStyle = color.hex;
    ctx.fill();
    // ... rest of your glow/trail logic using projected coords
}
```

You will also:

- Set `this.x/this.y` only for collision / detector checks from `screenX`/`screenY` *after* projection (or rewrite checks to use `worldX/worldY` directly).
- For detection screen y‑position (spots), project the `worldY/worldZ` at `detectorX` with the same formula, then use that projected Y for `addDetectionSpot`.

---

### 4. Visual result

With these changes:

- Z‑axis SG magnets still split vertically in world space.
- X‑axis SG magnets split along `worldZ`.
- Dragging left/right changes `viewAngle`, rotating the transverse (Y,Z) plane so you can see:
  - Pure vertical split (Z‑axis) when viewing from “front”
  - Pure horizontal split (X‑axis) when rotated by ~90°
  - Arbitrary oblique splits for intermediate angles.

This gives you a true 360° drag‑to‑rotate visualization of the beam splitting, without changing the underlying quantum logic; only the 3D projection layer is new.

---

**User**

The 360 drag and rotate is non functional

---

**Cursor**

Right now there is no actual 360° rotation logic in `Stern-Gerlach-multi.html`, which is why drag/rotate feels “non‑functional”: nothing in the draw code depends on a view angle, and there are no drag handlers wired up.

Here’s the minimal working setup you need to add so rotation really does something:

### 1. Add global view‑angle state

Near the other globals (just under `let stagePositions = [];`):

```javascript
let viewAngle = 0;          // radians, rotation around beam axis
let isDraggingView = false;
let lastDragX = 0;
```

### 2. Add drag handlers on the canvas/container

Near your init code at the bottom, after `resize();` and before `requestAnimationFrame(animate);`:

```javascript
const canvasContainer = document.getElementById('canvas-container');

canvasContainer.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
    isDraggingView = true;
    lastDragX = e.clientX;
});

window.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    if (!isDraggingView) return;
    const dx = e.clientX - lastDragX;
    lastDragX = e.clientX;
    const sensitivity = 0.005;  // tune as needed
    viewAngle += dx * sensitivity;  // 360° yaw
});

window.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
    isDraggingView = false;
});
```

This makes `viewAngle` change when you drag horizontally; next we must use it when drawing.

### 3. Use `viewAngle` when drawing atoms (so rotation is visible)

Right now `Atom.draw()` just uses `this.x`/`this.y` directly. To make rotation visible without rewriting all physics, interpret deflection as a 2D vector around the beam axis and rotate it.

Inside `Atom.draw()`, replace the part where you compute screen position with something like:

```javascript
draw() {
    const color = this.getColor();

    // Treat the beam centerline at y = centerY as “no deflection”
    const dy = this.y - centerY;   // transverse deflection magnitude
    const dz = 0;                  // you can later map X-axis splitting into this

    // Rotate transverse plane (dy,dz) around beam axis by viewAngle
    const cosA = Math.cos(viewAngle);
    const sinA = Math.sin(viewAngle);
    const rotatedY = dy * cosA - dz * sinA;

    const screenX = this.x;
    const screenY = centerY + rotatedY;

    // Use screenX / screenY instead of this.x / this.y for actual drawing
    // Example core:
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(screenX, screenY, this.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    ctx.fillStyle = color.hex;
    ctx.fill();

    // For trails, do the same rotation on each trail point’s y around centerY
    // using the same cosA/sinA.
}
```

Right now `dz` is 0 because the simulation is effectively 2D; once you route X‑axis splitting into a separate “horizontal” component, you’d put that into `dz` and the rotation will reveal horizontal vs vertical splitting as you turn the setup.

### Why it feels “non‑functional” now

- There is no `viewAngle` in the current file.
- No mouse/drag listeners ever update any rotation state.
- All drawing uses `this.x`/`this.y` directly, with no dependence on any camera angle.

Until you (1) track `viewAngle` from drag and (2) actually rotate the drawn positions using that angle (as above), dragging won’t change what you see.
